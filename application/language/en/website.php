    'article_workflow_intro' => 'According to a research done in the USA in 2013, only 4% of 700 companies are developing mobile apps to support supply chain management, logistics, purchase, purchase support, maintenance and service fields. On the other hand, all of these 700 companies believe that within two years at least half of the sector they work in will have their own mobile apps. Two years is really a short period of time for this 4% to increase.',
    'article_workflow_content' => '<h2>Mobile Apps Are Changing the Workflow – Is Your Company Ready For It?</h2>
		<p>According to a research done in the USA in 2013, only 4% of 700 companies are developing mobile apps to support supply chain management, logistics, purchase, purchase support, maintenance and service fields. On the other hand, all of these 700 companies believe that within two years at least half of the sector they work in will have their own mobile apps. Two years is really a short period of time for this 4% to increase.</p>
		<p>So, what does this mean for your company? Within two year, mobile apps developed for the use of internal communication of companies and competitive advantage will be more important. That’s why all managers should ask themselves this question: “In two years time, do I want my company to be one of the companies which has not developed mobile apps and not changed the workflow?” It is hard to answer, “Yes” to this question. </p>
		<p>In this case, the “hard trend” is a fact that companies will develop mobile apps adequate to them whereas the “soft trend” is whether you will use or not this application.</p>
		<p>There is one more point to consider: In the recent years, the use of smart phones and tablets has increased noticeably and this “hard trend” will continue rapidly. The cost of using business intelligence is decreasing with the increase of the capacity of wireless and wired networks, private and public cloud systems, as well. The question that has to be asked is, how to act whilst the costs are decreasing and the capacity is increasing. </p>
		<p>The key point is to evaluate whether your company has the capacity to develop mobile apps. Some companies do have the capacity whereas some do not and this depends on the size of both the company and the IT department. There are many young people who have the capacity and the talent to develop mobile apps. We suggest that you should employ or hire these people. To sum things up, if you do not have anyone who has the capacity and the talent to develop mobile apps, it is time to find one. Remember, they have a great added value that they offer today and will offer in the future. </p>
		<p>You should get ready for the mobile application revolution. Remember, we are facing two revolutions right now. First, a hardware revolution where smart phones and tablets are dominating over computers; second, a software revolution where mobile apps run these devices. That’s why you need the competence to develop your own mobile apps that can give you competitive advantage, instead of using ready-to-go application that your competitors can get easily, as well. Companies which use the mobility to change the workflow will gain new successes. It is the right time to transform the workflow. </p>',


    'article_whymobile_title' => 'Why Should You Go Mobile?',
    'article_whymobile_intro' => 'It is almost impossible to ignore the mobile revolution. News, papers, blogs are all about the smart phones and tablets, what you can do with these devices, how you can integrate them to your business, and how much place that take in our lives. With smart phones and tablets in our lives, computer sales have decreased and these mobile devices are now the kings in the market. Computers are still used to generate content but with mobile devices it is possible to reach and generate content right away. Researches say that we use computers during business hours whilst we start the day with smart phones and end it with tablets. The main reasons why users prefer mobile devices are the ease of use and that they can take it anywhere they go.',

		<p>It is almost impossible to ignore the mobile revolution.

Researches say that we use computers during business hours whilst we start the day with smart phones and end it with tablets. The main reasons why users prefer mobile devices are the ease of use and that they can take it anywhere they go. </p>
		<p>Another research shows users spend 86% of their time with mobile apps when using mobile devices whilst they spend only 14% of their time on mobile websites. </p>
		<p>Up until the beginning of 2013, there were only 1.186 billion mobile app users but this number is predicted to increase up to 4.4 billions in 2017. In 2013, 50 billions apps were downloaded from Apple App Store and 48 billions from Google Play. And in 2017 the total number of apps downloaded is predicted to be over 250 billions.  </p>
		<p>Another market expanding with mobile is online sales. People are getting used to the concept of online shopping and the number of shopping apps is increasing as well. The success of e-commerce portals such as Amazon and eBay support this. We should also remember that both the positive and negative comments and reviews of these purchases are made through social media channels. Furthermore mobile orders, online event RSVPs, subscriptions of online magazines and newspapers are tools that help increase business sales and gain customers. Small businesses should make use of these tools and gain competitive advantage through them. Larger businesses gain customers with their high advertising and marketing budgets whereas small businesses gain them with quality products and services and their reputation. It would be much more easier for small businesses to increase their customer numbers and their sales if they start benefiting from mobile apps. </p>',

		<p>Behind the success of strong brands, lie their strong brand equity and the increase of these brands in the market compared to their competitors. Brand awareness and bringing in diversity and innovation are among factors that increase brand equity. </p>
		<p>Today we live in a digital age, and companies which develop mobile apps and interact with their customers through them stand out among their competitors. For mobile users, two-way communication is much more important and it is possible to achieve this through mobile. There are more than 1 billion websites and the number of mobile apps is only 2.5 millions; this shows that there are many websites and companies have not yet entered the mobile app world. Now, if you go mobile today, you can start interacting with your customers and furthermore you can create a difference and stand out in the market. Besides, after this adaptation to the mobile world your brand equity would increase. </p>
		<p>Many brands have started developing their own apps to catch the increasing mobile app trend. With Galepress you can start being part of the trend and increase both your brand equity and awareness. Moreover, you don’t need to be a millionaire to develop apps for your brand; with different options and solutions matching your company’s needs you can develop the perfect mobile app.</p>
